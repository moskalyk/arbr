## background
let this be a queued-up snapshot into current progress of this project for where things are at and where things are going as entrance into the Ethonline hackathon. The overstory behind the project is long, but meaningful to me via [deep6.org](deep6.org). it began with a few coherence points in software alchemical ideation in the various ethereum global events.
* [gov10](https://youtu.be/_YaIWFzAqbg) was a land based phenomonen meant to unit people around shared bioregional clusters using money markets. 
* [m2m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY_ZUN1geeQ) was a personal generator function for bci interface data where AI models are stored locally first, to be used by other [activities](https://youtu.be/uozM-vpuBUs). 
* [eth(OS)tep](https://youtu.be/0ldbJx85HbA?t=61) is a collective hastas ritual physical clock looking that aims to solve climate as a data flow problem. 

all these projects will converge on the arbr protocol in a simplified smart contract implementation, with a prime focus on eth(OS)tep.

Technologies used: hands, ritual, ethereum, polygon, charged particles, filecoin, fluence network

## user stories:

* *Physical Analog*: As a user, I want to be able to take a walk to a tree, login via geocache or wood embedding, and contribute resources to further organize value to similiar trees.
* *Digital Metaverse*: As a user, I want to be able to choose from a list of tree totems with NFTs embedded in the signature, and accrue interest with instituional resources matching interest rates to scalable carbon sequestration projects via a cognitioners attention.

## progress (todo)
- Designs 
- Modules (NFTPort)
- Interface points
- Schema Design

## reflections on project: 

I‚Äôve always wanted to roll the stake of hackathons forward not just with presence or financial, but also composable pieces that might fit together with pieces along the way. Working on this. Allow the affordances of storytelling to merge via this critical artwork.

Always looking for more developer help on this adventure, together.
