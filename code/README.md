## Notice of Code insipiration: 

I should note some of the origins from where this code came from, was from an ethglobal hackathon project called NFTree. The idea was conceived prior, but, even augments some of my new findings with covalent bonds and charge resemblances if I were to think about what i'd want as a tree. 

* Thinking of trees as types of peripheries to the planet,
* we can accomodate affordances for interacting with the land
* inheriting the attributes of carbon sequestration
* and futures on timber prices for builing homes
* this is really exciting;

Various Charged Tree Affordances

```diff
	function plant() // with erc20
	function plantSeed() // with nft
	function graft() // grow with nft
	function grow() // grow with erc20
	function use() // release charge
	function trade() // swapability
```
It might have impact in other domains like streaming data using brain machine interfaces to pick up on like resonance groupings of individuals in ecological formations, like a forest, filled with different totem abstractions.

More on this is touched on in the Eth(OS)step Project.
