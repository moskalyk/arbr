Can you feel that?
It’s the vibration of everything around you. Everything is at frequency. You are at frequency. How amazing would it be to use this vibration to create biofeedback loops that can form a new rhythm – that can terraform our APIs for Earth?
Through Ethostep, we are developing a new culture using a brain-computer interface as a device to align people’s mental wellbeing, improve their coordination, and care for our climate. Forming a virtual tree as a collective, participants contribute to planting actual trees.
By participating in this research project, you are participating in defining the future of humanity by solving the problem of climate & ecological health through the development of a data flow solution.
We are putting together the virtual and the physical by collecting from old and new technologies. By building a new time, we are changing the way that we interact with technology. Frequencies and software alchemy lay the foundations for a digital forest.
Our developers are challenged with peer-to-peer technologies, blockchain, fluence, and charged particle as they work toward the entrance into Hackathon and other competitions where Ethostep aims to contribute to the carbon removal project with Elon Musk.
Reach out to find out more about this project and to HELP. We’re based in Canada, Toronto, the land where there are trees in water. So come gather and grow with us, developing a new culture and a new kind of future.
